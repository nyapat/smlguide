# Introduction

You've landed on the guide dedicated to explain how to make mods in Town of Salem 2 with Salem Mod Loader. Congratulations! :rocket:

We'll explain how to begin by demonstrating the process of creating an example mod that you can run yourself.

## Before you begin

You will need some basic knowledge of how a computer works, including command line tools such as the Windows terminal and how to install tools such as .NET (dotnet).

Basic programming knowledge will help you immensely, but many people have learned how to program from beginning projects like this in other games or applications. Just know that it will take time to get good at.

Here is some knowledge on how mods work;

- The base game is built in Unity; which uses C# as a scripting language to interface with objects built in the editor.
- By using a patcher, we can make our own C# code that can access any part of the games' code, and then swap out base game code for our own.
- Salem Mod Loader is mostly a UI for loading mods for the game; meaning it isn't necessarily required for modding, but is majorly helpful for non-modders!
- Mods are inspected and approved manually by Curtis, so that there is trust that any mod on the mod loader does not contain malware.

## Modding Rules

While this discretion is in place, any mod that follows these rules will generally be accepted;

- Do not upload malware
- Do not provide an unfair advantage to non-mod users (such as macro actions)
- Do not provide access to paid content (including paid for by Town Points) for free
- Do not facilitate abusive behaviour (chat spamming or game server spamming)
- Do not upload NSFW mods

If your mod follows these rules, it will likely be accepted. However, remember that your mod may be denied for any reason to prevent loopholes in the modding rules.

## Help From Modders

Experienced modders that have uploaded mods previously will have the role "Verified Developer" in the [Salem Mod Loader Discord](https://discord.gg/AdpRqzstfj). Feel free to ask any of them questions if you have concerns.

Have fun modding!
